        <p class="content m-t-20">This application is very simple. Giving students a chance to write about important
          values in their lives has been shown to help them stay resilient and perform up to their potential. But
          there’s a catch: they need to do these activities at the RIGHT time—before a stressful event. That’s where
          this app comes in.</p>
        <p class="content m-t-20">Here are the three steps that will deliver the activities to your students for maximal
          benefit.</p>

        beginning
        of the school year, or RIGHT NOW.</p>

      <p class="content-work m-t-20">You don’t have to get too specific here. There’s no harm to sending these
        activities to everyone. So the roster you create could be all the students in your classroom or a few students
        that you work with.</p>

        students to complete and we will keep you updated how it went. We’ll also send your students a brief survey
        before and after the activity to assess its impact, and we’ll share the results with you. If you like, you can
        see the activities before we send them.</p>
